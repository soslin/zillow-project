Project description
Predict the values of single unit properties that the tax district assesses using the property data from those whose last transaction was during the "hot months" (in terms of real estate demand) of May and June in 2017. 

Hypotheses
H0 : The number of bathrooms, bedrooms and number of square feet in a single-unit residence do not predict the assessed tax value

Ha : The number of bathrooms, bedrooms and number of square feet in a single-unit residence predict the assessed tax value

This project explores the Zillow database for 3 counties in California. It uses regression modeling of the number of bathrooms, bedrooms and number of square feet to predict the assessed value.

The model is reasonably robust, but could use fine tuning with additional variables.

The attached link contains variable definitions and notes on how the data was wrangled in preparation for analysis.
